What is GENESIS?
================
GENESIS (GENeralized-Ensemble SImulation System) is a suite of 
computer programs for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations 
of biomolecular systems. 

GENESIS is free software, distributed under the GNU General Public
License version 2 or later. You can freely redistribute it and/or
modify it as a derived work under the terms of GPL v2 or later. 
If possible, however, it would be greatly appreciated if you send us
feedbacks. Your cooperation helps us to keep developing and managing
this official GENESIS, providing all other GENESIS users qualified
codes.

In computational neural science, there is another 
"GENESIS (General Neuron Simulation System)" (http://www.genesis-sim.org/)
simulator, which has much longer history in the development 
[The Book of GENESIS] (http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-GENESIS-Exploring-SImulation/dp/0387949380/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394425468&sr=8-1&keywords=bower+beeman). 
Our "GENESIS" has been developed independently to investigate 
conformational dynamics of proteins, nucleic acids, 
biological membranes, and other biomolecules.
